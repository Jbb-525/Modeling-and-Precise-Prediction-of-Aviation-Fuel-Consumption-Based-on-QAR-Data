# Modeling-and-Precise-Prediction-of-Aviation-Fuel-Consumption-Based-on-QAR-Data
This project aimed to replicate existing models from the literature and continuously optimize them by incorporating processed QAR data to predict aircraft fuel consumption.

### Firstly, this project mainly contains the model reproduction by the author based on relevant paper reading:

* GA-BPNN, refering to the paper "Modeling the Fuel Flow-Rate of Transport Aircraft during Flight Phases Using Genetic Algorithm-Optimized Neural Networks" 

- PLS-PSO-ELMAN, refering to the paper "Aircraft Fuel Flow Prediction Based on PLS-PSO-Elman" 

* CPCLS, refering to the paper "A Novel Self-Organizing Constructive Neural Network for Estimating Aircraft Trip Fuel Consumption" 

-  CNN-LSTM, refering to the paper "Feature Extraction and Prediction of QAR data Based on CNN-LSTM" 

### Secondly, the LSTM-Attention model created by the authors is shown.


### Thirdly, Paper "_Enhancing Aircraft Fuel Prediction with LSTM-Attention: Examining Lag Effects Across the Entire Flight_" written based on the project are also presented.
